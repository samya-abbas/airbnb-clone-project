## 🧩 Database Design

### 👤 User Management

**Fields:** id, username/email, password, profile\_image, is\_host
**Relationships:**

* One user can have many properties, bookings, and reviews.

### 🏘️ Property Management

**Fields:** id, title, description, location, price\_per\_night
**Relationships:**

* One property belongs to one host, but can have many bookings and reviews.

### 📦 Booking System

**Fields:** id, user, property, check\_in/check\_out, total\_price
**Relationships:**

* One booking is tied to one user and one property. Each booking has one payment.

### 💰 Payment Processing

**Fields:** id, booking, amount, status, payment\_date
**Relationships:**

* A payment is tied to a single booking.

### 📝 Review System

**Fields:** id, user, property, rating, comment, created\_at
**Relationships:**

* Users review properties they have booked.

### ⚙️ Data Optimization

**Strategies:**

* Indexing (e.g., on location, price)
* Query optimization (e.g., `select_related`)
* Caching (frequently accessed views)
* Pagination (large datasets)
* Denormalized fields (e.g., average rating)
